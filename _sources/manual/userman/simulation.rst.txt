*******************************************
MD Simulations with Alexandria Force Fields
*******************************************

==================
Using ACT simulate
==================
The command *alexandria simulate* will perform a simulation in the gas phase, i.e. without periodic boundary conditions. This obviously limits the usefulness but the OpenMM software can be used for condensed-phase simulations using ACT force fields :cite:p:`Kriz2024a,Spoel2025b`.
The *alexandria simulate* utility is aimed for validation of the potentials, for instance by evaluating whether the total energy is conserved, it can be verified that the force is the derivative of the potential. 

The utility can also be used to minimize the energy of a molecule or small cluster

    alexandria simulate -minimize -ff actff.xml -f coords.pdb 
    -charges mp2.xml -c afterem.pdb -g minimize.log

where *actff.xml* is the force field file, *coords.pdb* is a structure file (*xyz* and *sdf*
are supported as well). The *alexandira -charges mp2.xml* indicates a molprop file (database) with monomeric (optimized) structures used for generating charges. The files *afterem.pdb* and *minimize.log* are output files.

========================
The ACT-OpenMM interface
========================
The OpenMM :cite:p:`Eastman2023a` software in its native form is controlled from Python scripts. This allows users great control over the simulations. OpenMM allows to specify user-defined energy functions, which we use to implement both Gaussian-distributed charges :cite:p:`Ghahremanpour2018b,Walz2018a` and many Van der Waals potentials :cite:p:`Kriz2024a` (see Section :ref:`sec-energy`).
To facilitate this, a special python code was implemented that makes it relatively easy for the user to run simulations and minimization. The first step is to convert an ACT force field file (*actff.xml}) to one compatible with OpenMM (*openmmff.xml*)::

    alexandria gentop -ff actff.xml -openmm openmmff.xml 
    -charges mp2.xml -db "water methanol"

with two additional arguments. First, flag *-charges mp2.xml* indicates a molprop file (database) with monomeric (optimized) structures used for generating charges and, second, the flag *-db "water methanol"* instruct the code to produce an OpenMM topology for those compounds. If one or more of the compounds is not present in the database, a warning will be issued.

---------------------------
MD simulations using OpenMM
---------------------------
It is easy to perform simulations based on an Alexandria force field. For this, we rely on the `OpenMM`_ software that you need to install separately. Then you can use the ACT python interface to OpenMM, as in this simple script, that we will call run.py::

  #!/usr/bin/env python3

  from act_openmm import ActOpenMMSim

  sim = ActOpenMMSim(pdbfile="file.pdb", 
                     datfile="dimer.dat",
                     xmlfile="ff.xml",
                     txtfile="output2.txt",
                     verbose=True)
  sim.run()
  sim.log_to_xvg("energy.xvg", [ "Potential Energy (kJ/mole)"])
  sim.log_to_xvg("temperature.xvg", [ "Temperature (K)" ])
  sim.log_to_xvg("density.xvg", [ "Density (g/mL)" ])

.. _OpenMM: https://openmm.org/

Here, we first instantiate an ActOpenMMSim object, and pass it a structure file *file.pdb*, a simulation parameter file *dimer.dat* and a force field file *ff.xml*. We also instruct the code that output should be written to *output2.txt* and that we want a lot of information in that file.
Then we can run it, that's all! The last three lines are for convenience of plotting the results. We can run this script using::

  python ./run.py    

or submitted to a cluster, preferably with GPUs available.

--------------------------------
Energy Minimization using OpenMM
--------------------------------
An energy minimization of the input structure can be done using this script::

  #!/usr/bin/env python3

  from act_openmm import ActOpenMMSim

  sim = ActOpenMMSim(pdbfile="file.pdb", 
                     datfile="dimer.dat",
                     xmlfile="ff.xml",
                     txtfile="output2.txt",
                     verbose=True)
  sim.setup()
  sim.minimize()
  sim.write_coordinates("final.pdb")

which is run here using the same flags as the simulation. Note that details about simulations and minimization can be specified in the *dimer.dat* file.
