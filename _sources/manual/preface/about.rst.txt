About the Alexandria Chemistry Toolkit
--------------------------------------
The Alexandria Chemistry Toolkit (ACT) allows for global optimization of force fields for molecular simulation. That means that, in principle, a whole force field can be derived at once by training parameters to reproduce results from *ab initio* or density functional theory as well as experimental data when available.

The ACT software consists, at the time of writing about 107,000 lines of C++ code, of which about 35,000 lines were generated by the Mathematica :sup:`TM` software (Section :ref:`sec-slater`). In addition about 7,500 lines of Python code are part of the ACT.
